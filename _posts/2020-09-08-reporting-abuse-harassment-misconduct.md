In recent days we’ve seen and heard a number of disturbing stories around sexual harassment, abuse and misconduct in our industry. 

We want to be very clear on our position: **these behaviors are never ok – not in our communities or any others.**

YAKA Games supports everyone that has come forward to report abuse and we are asking anyone who has experienced any kind of harassment or sexual misconduct in our community to come forward.

**We take every allegation seriously and we investigate it.**

We are deeply committed to ensuring there is safe space for people to come forward and taking the right actions on behalf of our community. The stories we’ve heard recently make it clear there is still a lot of work to be done in our industry.

If you have encountered harassment, violence or other misconduct by another player, member of our community, or staff member, there are multiple reporting resources which can be found.

Being part of a gaming community, whether you’re an employee, creator, player or anyone else, should be a positive, fun, fair, inclusive, and most importantly safe experience. 

This is a part of our commitment to Positive Play and we intend to continue to act on it.
