To our customers and players everywhere,

Over the last month our world has changed in unimaginable ways. 

Today close to half the people on earth are at home in an attempt to flatten to curve and slow the coronavirus pandemic. During this challenging time, our collective voices and actions can enhance each other’s lives, by helping us come together in play while staying at home.

Our community is already showing what an amazing force we can be when we come together. 

So our message is simple:  **Stay Home. Play Together**. At a time where we need to stay physically apart, games can be a source of joy and connection.  

For many in our community, they already are – and we’re going to be highlighting that through the content we are creating and sharing.

**Be safe and be well, everyone.**
